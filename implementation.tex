\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We implemented C2-AS-FI-MC as \texttt{C++} programs using the
libraries \texttt{NTL}~\cite{NTL} for finite field arithmetics,
\texttt{gf2x}~\cite{gf2x} for fast arithmetics in characteristic $2$
and \texttt{FAAST}~\cite{DFS09} for fast arithmetics in Artin-Schreier
towers.

This section mainly deals with some tricks we implemented in order to
speed up the computation. At the end of the section we briefly discuss
the implementation we made in Magma~\cite{Magma} of the algorithm
in~\cite{LeSi09}.

\subsection{Building $E[p^k]$ and $E'[p^k]$}
\label{sec:impl:torsion}

\paragraph{$p$-torsion}
For $p\ne2$, C2 and its variants require to build the extension
$\F_q[c]$ where $c$ is a $p-1$-th root of $H_E$. In order to deal with
the lowest possible extension degree, it is a good idea to modify the
curve so that $[\F_q[c]:\F_q]$ is the smallest possible.

$[\F_q[c]:\F_q]$ is invariant under isomorphism, but taking a twist
can save us a quadratic extension. Let $u=c^{-2}$, the curve
\begin{equation*}
  \bar{E} : y^2 = x^3 + a_2ux^2 + a_4u^2x + a_6u^3
\end{equation*}
is defined over $\F_q[c^2]$ and is isomorphic to $E$ over $\F_q[c]$
via $(x,y)\mapsto(\sqrt{u}^2x,\sqrt{u}^3y)$. Its Hasse invariant is
$H_{\bar{E}} = (u)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}H_E = 1$, thus its $p$-torsion
points are defined over $\F_q[c^2]$.

In order to compute the $p^k$-torsion points of $E$ we build
$\F_q[c^2]$, we compute $\bar{P}$ a $p^k$-torsion points of $\bar{E}$
using $p$-descent, then we invert the isomorphism to compute the
abscissa of $P\in E[p^k]$. Since the Cauchy interpolation only needs
the abscissae of $E[p^k]$, this is enough to complete the
algorithm. Scalar multiples of $P$ can be computed without knowledge
of $y(P)$ using Montgomery formulae \cite{Mon87}.

Remark that for $p=2$ we use the same construction in an implicit way
since we do a $p$-descent on the Kummer surface.


\paragraph{$p^k$-torsion points}
For $p\ne2$ we use Voloch's $p$-descent to compute the $p^k$-torsion
points iteratively as described in Section \ref{sec:C2}. To factor the
Artin-Schreier polynomial \eqref{th:voloch:cover}, we use the
algorithms from \cite{Cou00} and \cite{DFS09} that were analysed in
Section \ref{sec:C2-AS}. All these algorithms were provided by the
library \texttt{FAAST}.

To solve system \eqref{th:voloch:isom} we first compute
\begin{equation*}
  V(x,y) = \left(\frac{g(x)}{h^2(x)}, 
    sy\left(\frac{g(x)}{h^2(x)}\right)'\right)
\end{equation*}
through Vélu formulae.\footnote{Vélu formulae compute this isogeny up
  to an indeterminacy on the sign of the ordinate, the actual value of
  $s$ must be determined by composing $V$ with $\frobisog$ and
  verifying that it corresponds to $[p]$ by trying some random
  points.} Recall that we work on a curve having Hasse invariant $1$,
system \eqref{th:voloch:isom} can then be rewritten
\begin{equation*}
  \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
      X &= \frac{g(x)}{h^2(x)}\\
      Y &= sy\left(\frac{g(x)}{h^2(x)}\right)'\\
      Z &= -2y\frac{h'(x)}{h(x)}
    \end{aligned}
  \right.
\end{equation*}
where $(X,Y,Z)$ is the point on the cover $C$ that we want to pull
back. After some substitutions this is equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
  \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
      Xh^2(x) - g(x) &= 0\\
      \left(Xh^2(x) - g(x) - \frac{Y}{sZ}h^2(x)\right)' &= 0
    \end{aligned}
  \right.
\end{equation*}
Then a solution to this system is given by the GCD of the two
equations. Remark that proposition \ref{th:voloch} ensures there is
one unique solution. This formulae are slightly more efficient than
the ones in \cite[$\S$6.2]{Ler97}.

For $p=2$ we use the library \texttt{FAAST} (for solving
Artin-Schreier equations) on top of \texttt{gf2x} (for better
performance). There is nothing special to remark about the
$2$-descent.


\subsection{Cauchy interpolation and loop}
\label{sec:impl:cauchy}
The polynomial interpolation step is done as described in Section
\ref{sec:C2-AS-FI}. As a result of this implementation, the polynomial
interpolation algorithm was added to the library \texttt{FAAST}.

The rational fraction reconstruction is implemented using a fast XGCD
algorithm on top of \texttt{NTL} and \texttt{gf2x}. This algorithm was
added to \texttt{FAAST} too.

The loop uses modular composition as in Section~\ref{sec:C2-AS-FI-MC}
in order to minimise the number of interpolations. The timings in the
next section clearly show that this non-asymptotically-optimal variant
performs much faster in practice.

To check that the rational fractions are isogenies we test their
degrees, that their denominator is a square and that they act as group
morphisms on a fixed number of random points. All these checks take a
negligible amount of time compared to the rest of the algorithm.


\subsection{Parallelisation of the loop}
\label{parallel}

The most expensive step of C2-AS-FI-MC, in theory as well as in
practice, is the final loop over the points of $E'[p^k]$. Fortunately,
this phase is very easy to parallelise with very few overhead.

Let $n$ be the number of processors we wish to parallelise on, suppose
that $[\U_k:\F_q]$ is maximal, then we make only one interpolation
followed by $\euler(p^k)/2$ modular compositions.\footnote{If
  $[\U_k:\F_q]$ is not maximal, the parallelisation is straightforward
  as we simply send one interpolation to each processor in turn.} We
set $m=\left\lfloor\frac{\euler(p^k)}{2n}\right\rfloor$ and we compute
the action of $\frob^{m}$ on $E[p^k]$ as in
Section~\ref{sec:C2-AS-FI-MC}:
\begin{equation*}
  F^{(m)}(X) = F(X) \circ \cdots \circ F(X) \bmod T(X)
  \;\text{,}
\end{equation*}
this can be done with $\Theta(\log m)$ modular compositions via a
binary square-and-multiply approach as in~\cite[Algorithm
5.2]{vzGS92}.

Then we compute the $n$ polynomials
\begin{equation*}
  A_{mi}(X) = A_{m(i-1)}(X) \circ F^{(m)}(X) \bmod T(X)
\end{equation*}
and distribute them to the $n$ processors so that they each work on a
separate slice of the $A_i$'s. The only overhead is $\Theta(\log
(\ell/n))$ modular compositions with coefficients in $\F_q$, this is
acceptable in most cases.


\subsection{Implementation of~\cite{LeSi09}}
In order to compare our implementation with the state-of-the-art
algorithms, we implemented a Magma prototype of~\cite{LeSi09}; in what
follows, we will refer to this algorithm as LS. The algorithm
generalises~\cite{BoMoSaSc08} by lifting the curves in the $p$-adics
to avoid divisions by zero. Given two curves $E$ and $E'$ and an
integer $\ell$, it performs the following steps
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lift $E$ to $\bar{E}$ in $\Q_q$,
\item Lift the modular polynomial $\Phi_\ell$ to $\bar{\Phi}_\ell$ in
  $\Q_q$,
\item Find a root in $\Q_q$ of $\bar{\Phi}(X,j_{\bar{E}})$ that
  reduces to $j_{E'}$ in $\F_q$,
\item Apply~\cite{BoMoSaSc08} in $\Q_q$ to find an isogeny between
  $\bar{E}$ and $\bar{E}'$,
\item Reduce the isogeny to $\F_q$.
\end{enumerate}

We implemented this algorithm using Magma support for the
$p$-adics. Instead of the classical modular polynomials $\Phi_\ell$ we
used Atkin's canonical polynomials $\Phi^\ast_\ell$ since they have
smaller coefficients and degree; this does not change the other steps
of the algorithm. The modular polynomials were taken from the tables
precomputed in Magma.

The bottleneck of the algorithm is the use of the modular polynomial
as its bit size is $O(\ell^3)$, thus LS is asymptotically worse in
$\ell$ than C2. However the next section will show that LS is more
practical than C2 in many circumstances.
