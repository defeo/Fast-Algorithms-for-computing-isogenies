\section{Preliminaries on Isogenies}

Let $E$ be an ordinary elliptic curve over the field $\F_q$, we
suppose it is given to us as the locus of zeroes of a Weierstrass
equation
\[y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6
\qquad a_1,\ldots,a_6\in\F_q\text{.}\]

\paragraph{Simplified forms} If $p>3$ it is well known that the curve
$E$ is isomorphic to a curve in the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:weierstrass>3}
  y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
\end{equation}
and its $j$-invariant is $j(E) = \frac{1728(4a)^3}{16(4a^3 + 27b^2)}$.

When $p=3$, since $E$ is ordinary, it is isomorphic to a curve
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:weierstrass=3}
  y^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + b
\end{equation}
and its $j$-invariant is $j(E) = -\frac{a^3}{b}$.

Finally, when $p=2$, since $E$ is ordinary, it is isomorphic to a curve
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:weierstrass=2}
  y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b
\end{equation}
and its $j$-invariant is $j(E) = \frac{1}{b}$.

These isomorphism are easy to compute and we will always assume that
the elliptic curves given to our algorithms are in such simplified
forms.
