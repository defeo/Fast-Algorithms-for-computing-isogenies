\section{Introduction}

The problem of computing an explicit degree $\ell$ isogeny between two
given elliptic curves over $\F_q$ was originally motivated by point
counting methods based on Schoof's algorithm \cite{Atk91},
\cite{Elk91}, \cite{Sch95}. A review of the most efficient algorithms
to solve this problem is given in \cite{BoMoSaSc08} together with a
new quasi-optimal algorithm; however, all the algorithms presented in
\cite{BoMoSaSc08} compute the power series expansion of the
Weierstrass functions of the curves up to a certain precision, thus
they are limited to the case $\ell\ll p$ where $p$ is the
characteristic of $\F_q$. This is satisfactory for cryptographic
applications where one takes $p=q$ or $p=2$; indeed in the former case
Schoof's algorithm needs $\ell\in O(\log p)$, while in the latter case
there's no need to compute explicit isogenies since $p$-adic methods
based on \cite{Sat00} are preferred to Schoof's algorithm.

Nevertheless, the problem of computing explicit isogenies in the case
where $p$ is small compared to $\ell$ stays of theoretical interest
and can find practical applications in newer cryptosystems such as
\cite{Tes06}, \cite{RoSt06}. The first algorithm to solve this problem
was given by Couveignes and made use of formal groups \cite{Cou94}; it
takes $\tildO(\ell^3\log q)$ operations in $\F_p$ assuming $p$ is
constant, however it has an exponential complexity in $\log
p$. Another algorithm by Lercier specific to $p=2$ uses some linear
properties of the problem to build a linear system from whose solution
the isogeny can be deduced \cite{Ler96}; its complexity is conjectured
to be $\tildO(\ell^3\log q)$ operations in $\F_p$, but it has a much
better constant factor than \cite{Cou94}. At the moment we write the
latter algorithm is by many orders of magnitude the fastest algorithm
to solve practical instances of the problem when $p=2$, thus being the
\emph{de facto} standard for cryptographic use.

$p$-adic methods were used by Joux and Lercier \cite{JL06} and Lercier
and Sirvent \cite{LeSi09} to solve the isogeny problem. The former
method has complexity $\tildO(\ell^2(1 + \ell/p)\log q)$ operations in
$\F_p$, which makes it well adapted to the case where $p\sim\log
q$. The latter has complexity $\tildO(\ell^3 + \ell\log q^2)$
operations in $\F_p$, making it the best algorithm to our knowledge
for the case where $p$ is not constant.

\paragraph{The algorithm C2 and its variants}
Finally, the algorithm having the best asymptotic complexity in $\ell$
was proposed again by Couveignes in \cite{Cou96}, we will refer to
this original version as ``C2''. Its complexity --supposing $p$ is
fixed-- was estimated in \cite{Cou96} as being $\tildO(\ell^2\log q)$
operations in $F_p$, but with a precomputation step requiring
$\tildO(\ell^3\log q)$ operations and large memory
requirements. However this estimate was wrong as we will argue in
Section \ref{sec:} and C2 has an overall asymptotic complexity of
$\tildO(\ell^3\log q)$ operations.

Subsequent work by Couveignes used Artin-Schreier theory to avoid the
precomputation step of C2, drop the memory requirements to
$\tildO(\ell\log q + \log^2 q)$ elements of $\F_p$ and solve the issue
that made the estimate for the complexity of C2 false \cite{Cou00}. In
conclusion this variant has complexity $\tildO(\ell^2\log q)$, we
refer to it as ``C2-AS''.

However it has been recently shown in \cite{DFS09} that \cite{Cou00}
laid over some false assumptions on how fast arithmetics can be
performed in a tower of Artin-Schreier extensions. \cite{DFS09} fixes
the issue by giving asymptotically fast algorithms for Artin-Schreier
towers, but this is not enough to patch C2-AS as we will argue in
Section \ref{sec:}, thus bringing C2-AS back in the complexity class
$\tildO(\ell^3\log q)$.

The aim of this paper is to give a complete review of Couveignes'
algorithm and its variants, provide the missing piece to make it have
a quadratic dependency in $\ell$ and prove the accurate complexity
estimate of $\tildO(\incomplete)$ operations in $\F_p$. In Section
\ref{sec:} we also extend the algorithm beyond its original scope to
solve the more general problem of \emph{bounded degree isogeny
finding}; interestingly, this new algorithm turns out to have a better
asymptotic complexity than any previously known approach.

\paragraph{Notation and plan}
In the rest of the paper $p$ is a prime, $d$ a positive integer,
$q=p^d$ and $\F_q$ is the field with $q$ elements. For an elliptic
curve $E$ and a field $\K$ embedded in an algebraic closure
$\clot{\K}$, we note by $E(\K)$ the set of $\K$-rational points and by
$E[m]$ the $m$-torsion subgroup of $E(\clot{\K})$. The group law on
the elliptic curve is noted additively, its zero is the point at
infinity, noted $\0$. For an affine point $P$ we note by $x(P)$ its
abscissa and by $y(P)$ its ordinate. We will restrict ourselves to the
case of ordinary elliptic curves, thus $E[p^k]\isom\Z/p^k\Z$.

Unless otherwise stated, all time complexities will be measured in
number of operations in $\F_p$ and all space complexities in number of
elements of $\F_p$; we do not assume $p$ to be constant. We use the
notation $\tildO_x$ that forgets polylogarithmic factors in the
variable $x$, thus $O(xy\log x \log y)\subset\tildO_x(xy\log
y)\subset\tildO_{x,y}(xy)$. We simply note $\tildO$ when the variables
are clear from the context. We let $\Mult:\N\rightarrow\N$ be a
\emph{multiplication function}, such that polynomials of degree at
most $n$ with coefficients in $\F_p$ can be multiplied in $\Mult(n)$
operations, under the conditions of \cite[Ch. 8.3]{vzGG}. Typical
orders of magnitude are $O(n^{\log_23})$ for Karatsuba multiplication
or $O(n\log n\log\log n)$ for FFT multiplication.
